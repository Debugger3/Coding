 Given a very large binary number which cannot be stored in a variable, determine the remainder of the decimal equivalent of the binary number when divided by 3
I had no clue about this question. He gave me a hint, with which I was able to solve it. But later, he asked me to find the remainder for any number k. Again he gave a hint and I was able to solve it.

Basically when we append a digit to a binary number, the previous binary number gets doubled, hence the remainder also gets doubled.

For example :     101  -> 5
          1010 -> 2*5 + 0 = 10
              1011 -> 2*5 + 1 = 11
        
If k = 3 then  
    5 = 1*3 + 2
    2*5 = 2*3 + 2*2 
Hence the remainder will be
(2*2 + 0)%3 = 1 for 1010

Similarly for 1011 the remainder
will be (2*2 + 1)%3 = 2 

By keeping track of the remainder of the previous binary number, the current remainder can be determined.



An binary tree is given. He asked me to serialize and deserialize the given binary tree. I gave him the approach using pre order traversal and store the elements in array and using another array which will store whether a node element is leaf node or internal node.


Given a 2-D plane and number of points are given on that 2-D plane which are represented by its (x,y) co-ordinates. So i need to find the maximum number of points which can be lie on a single line.

Given a matrix calculate minimum cost path to reach from top-left to bottom-right. Suggested him the dp approach then he asked me if this will work with negative edges or not. I said yes it would work.
He then twisted the question a bit…now one can move in either of the four direction left,top,right and bottom and can contain negative edges. Suggested him recursive approach having exponential time complexity.


coins are lined up (eg. 100 200 50 2) Two players playing this game can pick a coin from either of the left or right end. Player with maximum sum will win. Both players are optimally playing the game. You have to tell that whatturn(1 or 2) should be chosen in order to win. Like in above example if you play first then can select coin 2(you want to get that 200 coin to win).

A tree is stored in an array such that value stored at index I is parent of node I. Firstly gave an nlog(n) approach as it came to mind first. He said to code it(coded it), then he insisted to optimize the solution with worst case time complexity O(n), then we discuss the DP solution he agreed on the logic and asked to code it (coded it).

Design a data structure for the following operations:

I.                Enqueue

II.               Dequeue

III.              Delete a given number(if it is present in the queue, else do nothing)

IV.               isNumberPresent

All these operations should take O(1) time.



Two robots land with their parachutes on an infinite one-dimensional number line. They both release their parachutes as soon as they land and start moving. They are allowed only to make use of the following functions.

I.                 moveLeft() // robot moves to left by 1 unit in 1 unit time

II.               moveRight() // robot moves to right by 1 unit in 1 unit time

III.              noOperation() // robot does not move and takes 1 unit time

IV.              onTopOfParachute() // returns true if the robot is standing on top of either of the parachute, else false

V.               didWeMeet() // returns true if the robot meets to the other robot, else false

Write a function in order to make the robots meet each other. Robots will be executing the same copy of this function.

Two trees can be called isomorphic if they have similar structure and the only difference amongst them can be is, that their child nodes may or may not be swaped..

for example

——4

—-2—6

–1–3–5–7

and

——4

—-6—2

–1–3–7–5

are isomorphic .. the trees are similar and a few nodes have their left and right child swapped…

Given two trees determine if they are isomorphic…
