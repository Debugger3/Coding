 Given a very large binary number which cannot be stored in a variable, determine the remainder of the decimal equivalent of the binary number when divided by 3
I had no clue about this question. He gave me a hint, with which I was able to solve it. But later, he asked me to find the remainder for any number k. Again he gave a hint and I was able to solve it.

Basically when we append a digit to a binary number, the previous binary number gets doubled, hence the remainder also gets doubled.

For example :     101  -> 5
          1010 -> 2*5 + 0 = 10
              1011 -> 2*5 + 1 = 11
        
If k = 3 then  
    5 = 1*3 + 2
    2*5 = 2*3 + 2*2 
Hence the remainder will be
(2*2 + 0)%3 = 1 for 1010

Similarly for 1011 the remainder
will be (2*2 + 1)%3 = 2 

By keeping track of the remainder of the previous binary number, the current remainder can be determined.



An binary tree is given. He asked me to serialize and deserialize the given binary tree. I gave him the approach using pre order traversal and store the elements in array and using another array which will store whether a node element is leaf node or internal node.


Given a 2-D plane and number of points are given on that 2-D plane which are represented by its (x,y) co-ordinates. So i need to find the maximum number of points which can be lie on a single line.
